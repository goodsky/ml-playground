I am following along the [Hands on Machine Learning with Scikit Learn, Keras & Tensorflow](https://github.com/tuitet/Hands-On-Machine-Learning-with-Scikit-Learn-Keras-and-TensorFlow-3rd-Edition) book.

# Setting up the Environment

## Python Virtual Environments

I don't use Python enough to remember this off the top of my head. Here's a reminder.

- Create a virtual environment: `python -m venv .env`
  - Note: `venv` comes packaged with python3 but `virtualenv` is a separate package. Either will work.
- Activate a virtual environment: `./.env/Scripts/activate`
- Deactivate a virtual environment: `deactivate`

## Packages

- Jupyter
- Matplotlib
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Scipy
- scikit-learn
- tensorflow

## Jupyter

When using a virtual environment, you may need to register it for Jupyter with `python -m ipykernel install --user --name=python3`
